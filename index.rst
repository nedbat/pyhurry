Python In A Hurry
#################

This is Python in a Hurry, or more fully, *Python in a Hurry for Experienced
Programmers*.  It is a quick introduction to Python for people who have
programmed before.

Python in a Hurry:

    * will teach you enough Python to be productive, and

    * will do it quickly.

On the other hand, Python in a Hurry won't do everything:

    * it will not be exhaustive, showing Python esoterica that will slow down
      your learning, and

    * it will not give you a deep understanding of the subtleties of Python,
      and

    * it will not try to convince you that Python is the best, or even a good,
      programming language (though it is!), and

    * it will not waste your time.
