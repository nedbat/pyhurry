Python In A Hurry
#################

This is Python in a Hurry, or more fully, *Python in a Hurry for Experienced
Programmers Who Don't Want to Learn Yet Another Language*.  It is written for a
particular audience: developers who need to know enough Python to get a small
task done, and then want to get back to their real work.  It's especially
designed for team members who need to learn a little bit, and who have a Python
guru on hand who can help with the trickier parts.

Python in a Hurry:

    * will teach you enough Python to be productive, and

    * will do it quickly.

On the other hand, Python in a Hurry:

    * will not be complete, showing Python esoterica that will slow down your
      learning, or

    * will not give you a deep understanding of the subtleties of Python, or

    * will not try to convince you that Python is the best, or even a good,
      programming language (though it is!), or

    * will not waste your time.
